HOC -   is a function that takes a component as input and returns a new enhanced component.
It’s a pattern for reusing component logic without repeating code.

const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);

WrappedComponent → the original component
higherOrderComponent → function that adds extra props, behavior, or logic
EnhancedComponent → the new component with added features
